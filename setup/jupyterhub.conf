# Elasticluster JupyterHub example
#
# This example shows how to set up a single-node JupyterHub server:
# ElastiCluster will provision a virtual machine, install
# Jupyter/IPython and configure the JupyterHub server to run as a
# service over the default HTTPS website. (By default, a self-signed
# TLS/SSL certificate is used for HTTPS.)
#
# It is a complete and self-contained example that should get you
# started with running JupyterHub servers on Google Cloud Platform.
# You can replace the `[cloud/google]` and `[login/google]` sections
# to get a JupyterHub server running on any other cloud.
#
# In order to use the JupyterHub server:
#
# 1. Note down the IP address of the server VM created by ElastiCluster
# 2. In your browser, open https://server.ip/
# 3. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate in the browser
# 4. Log in using username and password
#
# Note that you must edit the default security group to allow
# connections to port 443!
#


# JupyterHub software to be configured by Ansible
#
# (There is nothing Google-specific in the "setup" section; in fact, it can be
# re-used verbatim with *any* cloud provider or base image)
#
[setup/jupyterhub]
provider=ansible
server_groups=jupyterhub


# The following stanza defines a "cluster" made of a single VM which
# runs JupyterHub configured to provide Python 2.x and 3.x notebooks.
