A short introduction to Python, NumPy, and Pandas
=================================================

This repository collects slides, exercises and other supporting material used in
Python language introduction courses that I deliver on-demand.

The material in this course covers:

* the basics of Python programming, up to the point of being able to do simple loops,
  file I/O, and basic data structure manipulation (parts 01 through 05);
* basics of NumPy and plotting with Matplotlib/Seaborn (part 07);
* table manipulation with Pandas (part 08).
* a short overview of how to run pleasantly parallel workflows with [GC3Pie][7]
  (parts 09 and 10).

The last parts are meant to be independent; those who already know Python
programming may want to skip parts 01 through 05 altogether.

Basic computer programming knowledge (e.g., what is a variable, what is a loop)
is assumed and not covered in the material: students should already be familiar
with scripting languages (e.g. bash, perl) and have already written some
computer programs.

How to use the material
-----------------------

The IPython notebooks in files `*.EX.ipynb` (in folder `exercises/`) contain
exercises to be solved during the course. A copy of the notebooks with complete
solutions, is available in the `solutions/` subdirectory. A PDF slide deck
introduces and completements the first exercise notebook; for parts 7 and 8,
commentary and links are directly embedded in the notebook and there is no
separate slide deck.


Where has this been used?
-------------------------

So far, the material here has been used in a few occasions:

* at [BrainHack Zurich][x1] on March 2, 2017.
* for the ScITS training [Introduction to Workflows with Python][x2]
  at the University of Bern on June 8, 2017.
* for the ScITS training [Introduction to Python for science][x3]
  at the University of Bern in various occasions in 2017 and 2018.
